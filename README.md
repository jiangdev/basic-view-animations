# basic-view-animations
A basic example of using UI View Animations in Swift 4.. with a paw-some theme!

This example project was prepared for the Launchcode, Coder Girl Swift iOS course. This project features UI Animation view examples including:
  1. A springy table view that springs table view cells from the bottom up.
  2. A view that slowly fades one image view onto another.
  3. A view that moves back and forth, on repeat.
  4. A view that moves and rotates back and forth, on repeat.
  5. A view that springs forwards and backwards, on repeat.
  6. A view that transforms from one view to another, on click.
